    "\n",
    "Sentiment Intensity Analyzer (sid) is an AI bot that is trained on millions of pieces of text. Each text is labeled (supervised learning) with either a positive, negative, or neutral score. In other words, a sentence is a collection of positive, negative, and neutral words, and by taking the compound score, you can figure out if it is a pos, neg, or netural sentence.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine reading the sentence 'The blue dog is horrendous!' \n",

    " ('is', 0.0),<br>\n",
    " ('horrendous!', -0.6239)]\n",
    " \n",

tampering with an Election They were so far off in their polling and in their attempt to suppress that they should be called out for Election Interference Pleased to announce that have just joined our great StopTheSteal group of Senators They will fight the ridiculous Electoral College Certification of Biden How do you certify numbers that have now proven to be wrong and in many cases fraudulent If Joe Biden were President you would not have the Vaccine for another four years nor would the have ever approved it so quickly The bureaucracy would have destroyed millions of lives The and the Democrats did not want to have me get a Vaccine WIN prior to the election so instead it came out five days later As I have said all along Who will be running for Governor of the Great State of Ohio Will be hotly contested Another Vaccine just announced This time by Moderna effective For those great historians please remember that these great discoveries which will end the China Plague all took

The Cases are up because TESTING is way up by far the most and best in the world Mortality rate is DOWN plus Why will not they do it and why are they so fast to certify a meaningless tally The Governor of Georgia and Secretary of State refuse to let us look at signatures which would expose hundreds of thousands of illegal ballots and give the Republican Party and me David Perdue and perhaps Kelly Loeffler a BIG VICTORY If I do not sound like a typical Washington politician it is because I am NOT a politician If I do not always play by the rules of the Washington Establishment it is because I was elected to fight for YOU harder than anyone ever has before I could not sit by and watch THEM take advantage of YOU anymore They are coming after me because I am standing in their way and standing guard for this Country we LOVE For years I watched one betrayal after another as politicians like Joe Biden sold out American Workers at every turnshattering the lives of millions of American families while THEIR families raked in millions of dollars Joe Biden is a corrupt politician and he is COMPROMISED China is desperate for Biden to win because if Biden Wins CHINA WINS and China will OWN AMERICA This corruption is EXACTLY why I decided to run for President in the first place THANK YOU to all of the Great American Patriots in The Villages Florida MAGA I am asking for everyone at the YOUS Capitol to remain peaceful No violence Remember WE are the Party of Law Order respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue Thank you On the th anniversary of the horrendous

Here is How It Went Down They shut out our Poll Watchers and Observers Those hundreds of thousands of votes should not be allowed Corrupt politics Joe Bidens response to the HN Swine Flu far less lethal than Covid was one of the weakest and worst in the history of fighting epidemics and pandemics It was pathetic those involved have said Joe did not have a clue The Georgia recount is a joke and is being done UNDER PROTEST Even though thousands of fraudulent votes have been found the real number is in matching signatures Governor must open up the unconstitutional Consent Decree and call in the Legislature They did not even allow Republican Observers into the building to watch A terrible insult to our Constitution These are the things and events that happen when a sacred landslide election victory is so unceremoniously viciously stripped away from great patriots who have been badly unfairly treated for so long Go home with love in peace Remember this day forever The numbers have not improved it is still out of balance stated Wayne County Michigan Canvassers There is widespread irregularities in poll numbers There are more votes than people The two harassed patriot Canvassers refuse to sign the papers SeanParnellUSA is a bright star for Pennsylvania Military Vets Low Taxes and your nd Amendment will be totally protected His opponent is a weak and ineffective puppet for Pelosi and her new Radical Left friends Vote for Sean Parnell Obama spied on our campaign and got caught So important to VOTE for Republicans in the House Break away from Pelosi and her high Taxing new Radical Left friends Protect your nd Amendment Military Vets and sooo much more People will not accept this Rigged Election The great American Patriots who voted for me AMERICA FIRST and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way shape or form No the Election was a total scam we won by a lot and will hopefully turn over the fraudulent result but we must get out and help David and Kelly two GREAT people Otherwise we are playing right into the hands of some very sick people I will be in Georgia on Saturday Pennsylvania Ballot mistakes made in my opinion on purpose by the Democrat Governor puts Republicans in particular at great risk Corrupt politics in Pennsylvania must be investigated immediately By the way Philadelphia is out of control To all of those who have asked I will not be going to the Inauguration on January th THIS SAYS IT ALL I have reversed the ridiculous decision to cancel Wreaths Across America at Arlington National Cemetery It will now go on The recent statement by Chris Krebs on the security of the Election was highly inaccurate in that there were massive improprieties and fraud including dead people voting Poll Watchers not allowed into polling locations glitches in the voting machines which changed Yesterdays news conference being broadcast in full now on Enjoy Have a GREAT MAGAGRAS Rally today on our wonderful Long Island Cut Taxes Stop Crime VOTE FOR TRUMP Our City and State are a MESS What do you have to lose Thank you Congratulations to for his dogged pursuit as Chairman of Homeland of POLITICAL CORRUPTION Important News Conference today by lawyers on a very clear and viable path to victory Pieces are very nicely falling into place RNC at PM All newly rebuilt military THANK YOU NEW HAMPSHIRE Amazing Big victory moments ago in the State of Nevada The all Democrat County Commissioner race on same ballot as President just thrown out because of large scale voter discrepancy Clark County officials do not have confidence in their own election security Major impact THEY WOULDNT LET REPUBLICAN POLL WATCHERS INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS UNCONSTITUTIONAL Wrong At first they voted against because there were far more VOTES than PEOPLE Sad Then they were threatened screamed at and viciously harassed and were FORCED to change their vote but then REFUSED as American patriots to sign the documents MESS Do not Harass The only thing secure about our Election was that it was virtually impenetrable by foreign powers On that the Trump Administration takes great credit Unfortunately the Radical Left Democrats Dominion and others were perhaps more successful votes from Trump to Biden late voting and many more Therefore effective immediately Chris Krebs has been terminated as Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency DEAD PEOPLE VOTED So much truth Well it is really quite simple You just cannot have more votes than people More votes than people and that is the least of it Flip Michigan back to TRUMP Detroit not surprisingly has tremendous problems Carney Joe Bidens Energy Plan Would Eviscerate Wisconsin Sand Miners via Wisconsin would be badly hurt because Biden would definitely end Fracking No more Sand Mine usage Big Tech and the Fake News Media have partnered to Suppress Freedom of the Press is gone a thing of the past That is why they refuse to report the real facts and figures of the Election or even where is Hunter The rate of rejected MailIn Ballots is Xs lower in Pennsylvania this year than it was in This is why they kept our poll watchers and observers out of the SACRED vote counting rooms Georgia will not let us look at the all important signature match Without that the recount is MEANINGLESS Open up unconstitutional Consent Decree NOW Wow Governor Kemp will hopefully see the light before it is too late Must finally take charge Two GREAT Senators who do so much for Georgia and truly love the USA are in a must win battle with two incompetents who do not have a clue European Countries are sadly getting clobbered by the China Virus The Fake News does not like reporting this Trump Announces Groundbreaking Rules to Lower Prescription Drug Prices via This is true but much different than reported by the media We will show massive and unprecedented fraud Biden can only enter the White House as President if he can prove that his ridiculous votes were not fraudulently or illegally obtained When you see what happened in Detroit Atlanta Philadelphia Milwaukee massive voter fraud he is got a big unsolvable problem Massive voter fraud will be shown The Fake Pollsters at produced a possibly illegal suppression Poll just before the Election showing me down points in Wisconsin when in fact on Election Day the race was even we are now preparing to win the state Many such deplorable instances My son Donald is doing very well Thank you THANK YOU MAINE MAGA Biden did poorly in big cities Politico except those of Detroit more votes than people Philadelphia Atlanta and Milwaukee which he had to win Not surprisingly they are all located in the most important swing states and are long known for being politically corrupt Thank you Rabbis Richard Hopkins Pennsylvania postal worker recants ballottampering claim Washington Times Stays with the truth his original story A guy named Al Schmidt a Philadelphia Commissioner and socalled Republican RINO is being used big time by the Fake News Media to explain how honest things were with respect to the Election in Philadelphia He refuses to look at a mountain of corruption dishonesty We win Congratulations to Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev who just agreed to adhere to a cease fire effective at midnight Many lives will be saved Proud of my team Steve Biegun for getting the deal done I agree The restaurant business is being absolutely decimated Congress should step up and help Time is of the essence Rudy Giuliani will be on Greg Kelly Reports PM Great people Vote for Trump Big voter fraud information coming out concerning Georgia Stay tuned Biden dumped New Hampshire in the Dem Primaries left early I had my first big victory there Do it again Check out new show tonight at pm on Good luck Darrell The votes were created out of thin air I won Pennsylvania by a lot perhaps more than anyone will ever know The Pennsylvania votes were RIGGED All other swing states also The world is watching In honor of Maine So much credit to all of the brave men and women in state houses who are defending our great Constitution Thank you You are looking at BALLOTS Is this what our Country has come to Alan Dershowitz Trump was Absolutely Right to Pardon Michael Flynn via Suburban women are STRONG for President Trump Watch this clip WE WILL WIN Texas Pennsylvania Ohio and others please watch His party and Joe will stop Fracking immediately Millions of jobs lost as energy prices soar Vote Trump Watch Hundreds of Activists Gather for Stop the Steal Rally in Georgia via BreitbartNews Big Rallies all over the Country The proof pouring in is undeniable Many more votes than needed This was a LANDSLIDE FoxNews daytime is virtually unwatchable especially during the weekends Watch or almost anything else You will not have to suffer through endless interviews with Democrats and even worse Everyone is asking why the recent presidential polls were so inaccurate when it came to me Because they are FAKE just like much of the Lamestream Media I am pleased to announce that I have given my full support and endorsement to Ronna McDaniel to continue heading the Republican National Committee RNC With MILLION votes we received more votes than any sitting President in YOUS history and we will win President Trump has done many great things biggest tax regulation cuts in history Space Force rebuilding our military fixing the VA the Wall but perhaps the most important of all will be what he is doing now exposing the massive corruption in our Electoral Process The Wisconsin recount is not about finding mistakes in the count it is about finding people who have voted illegally and that case will be brought after the recount is over on Monday or Tuesday We have found many illegal votes Stay tuned Joe Biden was a total disaster in handling the HN Swine Flu would never have produced a Vaccine in record time years ahead of schedule and would do a terrible job of Vaccine delivery But does not everybody already know that Specific allegations were made and we have massive proof in the Pennsylvania case Some people just do not want to see it They want nothing to do with saving our Country Sad The number of ballots that our Campaign is challenging in the Pennsylvania case is FAR LARGER than the vote margin It is not even close Fraud and illegality ARE a big part of the case Documents being completed We will appeal Nobody wants to report that Pennsylvania and Michigan did not allow our Poll Watchers andor Vote Observers to Watch or Observe This is responsible for hundreds of thousands of votes that should not be allowed to count Therefore I easily win both states Report the News The Fake News is not talking about the fact that Covid is running wild all over the World not just in the YOUS I was at the Virtual

the Sleepy Joe Biden Rally in Ohio The reporting and polls are a Media Con Job Fake News We have far more support and enthusiasm than even in November rd will be a great day for America MAGA A parade for me in Nigeria a great honor Some friendly health advice to Iran If one American is killed I will hold Iran responsible Think it over One of the Trump Administrations great achievements into the future will be the authorization and start up of the SPACE FORCE years since Air Force Congratulations to all Our embassy in Baghdad got hit Sunday by several rockets Three rockets failed to launch Guess where they were from IRAN Now we hear chatter of additional attacks against Americans in Iraq After seeing the massive Voter Fraud in the Presidential Election I disagree with anyone that thinks a strong fast and fair Special Counsel is not needed IMMEDIATELY This was the most corrupt election in the history of our Country and it must be closely examined He did not win the Election He lost all Swing States by a lot They then dumped hundreds of thousands of votes in each one and got caught Now Republican politicians have to fight so that their great victory is not stolen Do not be weak fools discussing the possibility that it may be China it may There could also have been a hit on our ridiculous voting machines during the election which is now obvious that I won big making it an even more corrupted embarrassment for the USA The Cyber Hack is far greater in the Fake News Media than in actuality I have been fully briefed and everything is well under control Russia Russia Russia is the priority chant when anything happens because Lamestream is for mostly financial reasons petrified of Get out VOTE Under my Administration our ECONOMY is growing at the fastest rate EVER at Next year will be the GREATEST ECONOMIC YEAR in American History Find your polling place below WE ARE LOOKING REALLY GOOD ALL OVER THE COUNTRY THANK YOU Rush is the GREATEST Very happy to have helped get

have already received the China Virus Vaccine a record pace I will be making a statement tonight A big WIN We are up BIG but they are trying to STEAL the Election We will never let them do it Votes cannot be cast after the Polls are closed We do not want to have lockdowns The cure cannot be worse than the problem itself At a meeting in Florida today everyone was asking why are not the Republicans up in arms fighting over the fact that the Democrats stole the rigged presidential election Especially in the Senate they said where you helped Senators win their races How quickly they forget Marias show and ratings are better than ever They are trying to shame her into not telling the truth Her audience would be gone and she is far too smart for that Rigged Election The lie of the year is that Joe Biden won Christina Bobb Last night I was leading often solidly in many key States in almost all instances Democrat run controlled Then one by one they started to magically disappear as surprise ballot dumps were counted VERY STRANGE and the pollsters got it completely historically wrong VOTER FRAUD IS NOT A CONSPIRACY THEORY IT IS A FACT Twitter is going wild with their flags trying hard to suppress even the truth Just shows how dangerous they are purposely stifling free speech Very dangerous for our Country Does Congress know that this is how Communism starts Cancel Culture at its worst End Section How come every time they count MailIn ballot dumps they are so devastating in their percentage and power of destruction WHAT IS THIS ALL ABOUT I saved at least Republican Senators including Mitch from losing in the last Rigged for President Election Now they almost all sit back and watch me fight against a crooked and vicious foe the Radical Left Democrats I will NEVER FORGET MERRY CHRISTMAS True I will be overturning this ridiculous order immediately Watch NOW on the Election Fraud Made many calls and had meetings at Trump International in Palm Beach

YOUS was going to do for North Korea I have got plenty of other Bolton stupid stories Martial law Fake News Just more knowingly bad reporting But we already know enough and we won big Our lawyers have asked for meaningful access but what good does that do The damage has already been done to the integrity of our system and to the Presidential Election itself This is what should be discussed Why is not Congress giving our people a Stimulus Bill It was not their fault it was the fault of China GET IT DONE and give them more money in direct payments Our defense bill is a gift to China Russia Big

matter of days Ken Starr former Independent Counsel hopefully this will be corrected at the Supreme Court of the United States Also these late ballots past Election Day are illegal exactly what the

the great miracle of what the Trump Administration has accomplished They said it could not be done The President was responsible for those direct payments to Americans in the Covid Relief Bill And the Moderna vaccine has already started rolling out Very smooth distribution THE DEMOCRATS DUMPED HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF BALLOTS IN THE SWING STATES LATE IN THE EVENING IT WAS A RIGGED ELECTION Time for Republican Senators to step up and fight for the Presidency like the Democrats would do if they had actually won The proof is irrefutable Massive late night mailin ballot drops in swing states stuffing the ballot boxes on video double voters dead voters fake signatures illegal immigrant voters banned Republican vote watchers MORE VOTES THAN ACTUAL VOTERS check out Detroit Philadelphia and much more The numbers are far greater than what is necessary to win the individual swing states and cannot even be contested Republicans in the Senate so quickly forget Right now they would be down seats without my backing them in the last Election RINO John Thune Mitchs boy should just let it play out South Dakota does not like weakness He will be primaried in political career over Bad things took place during those hours where LEGAL TRANSPARENCY was viciously crudely not allowed Tractors blocked doors windows were covered with thick cardboard so that observers could not see into the count rooms BAD THINGS HAPPENED INSIDE BIG CHANGES TOOK PLACE This would ALSO change the Election result in numerous States including Pennsylvania which everyone thought was easily won on Election Night only to see a massive lead disappear without anyone being allowed to OBSERVE for long intervals of time what the happened People were screaming STOP THE COUNT WE DEMAND TRANSPARENCY As Legal Observers were refused admittance to count rooms Breaking News In Pennsylvania there were more votes than there were voters This alone flips the state to President Trump NewtGingrich Pens OpEd on Election Saying he will not Accept Joe Biden as President Newt Gingrich gets it we are going to WIN Statement by Donald J Trump The President of the United States Full Video Big press conference today in Philadelphia at Four Seasons Total Landscaping am Governor and his puppet together with the Secretary of State of Georgia are very slow on Signature Verification and will not allow Fulton County to be examined What are these RINOS hiding We will easily win Presidential State race and They are slow walking the signature verification in Georgia They do not want results to get out prior to January th They know what they are trying so hard to hide Terrible people Georgia Counties Using Same Software as Michigan Counties Also Encounter Glitch via What a total mess this election has been I WON THIS ELECTION BY A LOT Courts are bad the FBI and Justice did not do their job and the United States Election System looks like that of a third world country Freedom of the press has been gone for a long time it is Fake News and now we have Big Tech with Section to deal with But when it is all over and this period of time becomes just another ugly chapter in our Countrys history WE WILL WIN THE OBSERVERS WERE NOT ALLOWED INTO THE COUNTING ROOMS I WON THE ELECTION GOT LEGAL VOTES BAD THINGS HAPPENED WHICH OUR OBSERVERS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO SEE NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE MILLIONS OF MAILIN BALLOTS WERE SENT TO PEOPLE WHO NEVER ASKED FOR THEM Legal Votes The most EVER for a sitting President Conservatives Call on State Legislators to Appoint New Electors in Accordance with the Constitution and Detroit with a long series of election problems to put it mildly how these ballots were authenticated because if there is a problem in the system about authentication that would seriously affect the ENTIRE ELECTION And what concerns me is that we had over a hundred million mailin ballot in cites like Philladelphia Supreme Court Justice to compel them to separate ballots that were received after the legislative deadline It required the intervention of Justice Alito That is a large group of ballots When you talk about systemic problems it is about We should look at the votes We are just beginning the tabulation stage We should look at these allegations We are seeing a number of affidavits that there has been voter fraud We have a history in this country of election problems In Pennsylvania you had an order by a Where it mattered they stole what they had to steal We believe these people are thieves The big city machines are corrupt This was a stolen election Best pollster in Britain wrote this morning that this clearly was a stolen election that it is impossible to imagine that Biden outran Obama in some of these states Since when does the Lamestream Media call who our next president will be We have all learned a lot in the last two weeks Give the people not They have suffered enough This is what we know We have to go back to the state level and how this morass came to be in the first instance The Governor Wolf and the State Supreme Court flagrantly violated the Constitution of the YOUS The power to set these rules and regulations is vested in the Investigators Dispatched After Fulton County Discovers Issue with Ballot Reporting via WOW he just voted against me in a Big Court Decision on voter fraud of which there was much despite many pages of dissent from three highly respected Justices One thing has nothing to do with another but we ended up losing in a really incorrect ruling Great Two years ago the great people of Wisconsin asked me to endorse a man named Brian Hagedorn for State Supreme Court Justice when he was getting destroyed in the Polls against a tough Democrat Candidate who had no chance of losing After my endorsement Hagedorn easily won Watch at PM Will discuss the MailIn Ballot Hoax shmopniggadick has got my vote Weak and tired Republican leadership will allow the bad Defense Bill to pass Say goodbye to VITAL Section termination your National Monuments Forts names and Treasures inserted by Elizabeth Pocahontas Warren G and our great soldiers being removed and brought home from foreign lands who do NOTHING for us A disgraceful act of cowardice and total submission by weak people to Big Tech Negotiate a better Bill or get better leaders NOW Senate should not approve NDAA until fixed for our great people not They have suffered enough from the China Virus TrumpAdvice and CongressmenCongresswomen Elected I do believe they forgot Can you imagine if the Republicans stole a Presidential Election from the Democrats All hell would break out Republican leadership only wants the path of least resistance Our leaders not me of course are pathetic They only know how to lose PS I got MANY Senators more votes than is needed by me to win Pennsylvania not to mention hundreds of thousands of votes in other categories which increase my already big lead into a landslide All other Swing States show likewise WE NEED NEW ENERGETIC REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP This can not stand A group of Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania say more votes were counted in the Election than voters went to Biden State Representative Frank Ryan said they found troubling discrepancies after an analysis of Election Day data This is far Unless Republicans have a death wish and it is also the right thing to do they must approve the payments AS SOON AS POSSIBLE IS NOT ENOUGH Also get rid of Section Do not let Big Tech steal our Country and do not let the Democrats steal the Presidential Election Get tough STOCK MARKET UP BIG VACCINE COMING SOON REPORT EFFECTIVE SUCH GREAT NEWS Loeffler Perdue Support Increasing Relief Payments to K via Republicans must support the payments and must FIGHT the crooked presidential election We won big It

along quickly but gotten them to the states Biden failed with Swine Flu When are we going to be allowed to do signature verification in Fulton County Georgia The process is going VERY slowly

made with Iran Now it turns out that Brad Rs brother works for China and they definitely do not want Trump So disgusting MAGA I love the Great State of Georgia but the people who run it from the Governor to the Secretary of State are a complete disaster and do not have a clue or worse Nobody can be this stupid Just allow us to find the crime and turn the state Republican other acts of fraud and irregularities as well STAY TUNED that quite frankly did not have much of a chance like or The Presidential Election was Rigged with hundreds of thousands of ballots mysteriously flowing into Swing States very late at night as everyone thought the election was easily won by me There were many The Wall Street Journals very boring incoherent Editorial fails to mention my big easy wins in

title of the years Most Admired Man Trump number one Obama number two and Joe Biden a very distant number three That is also rather odd given the fact that on November rd Biden allegedly racked up millions more votes than Trump but cannot get anywhere close to him in this poll No incoming president has ever done as badly in this annual survey That is because he got millions of Fake Votes in the Election which was RIGGED TrumpVlog Obama should be ashamed The Federal Government has distributed the vaccines to the states Now it is up to the states to administer Get moving AS SOON AS POSSIBLE

would not have had this problem Never learn Thank you Madison Herschel is speaking the truth Only because Biden got very few votes just like the Election Because of the Trump Administration hospitals are now required effective immediately to publish their REAL PRICES which will create competition and drive downs costs MASSIVELY Won lawsuit last week Bigger than healthcare it is called PRICE TRANSPARENCY Please remember who got it done Some States are very slow to inoculate recipients despite successful and very large scale distribution of vaccines by the Federal Government They will get it done Before even discussing the massive corruption which took place in the Election which gives us far more votes than is necessary to win all of the Swing States only need three it must be noted that the State Legislatures were not in any way responsible for the massive is therefore both illegal and invalid and that would include the two current Senatorial Elections In Wisconsin Voters not asking for applications invalidates the Election All of this without even discussing the millions of fraudulent votes that were cast or altered changes made to the voting process rules and regulations many made hastily before the election and therefore the whole State Election is not legal or Constitutional Additionally the Georgia Consent Decree is Unconstitutional the State Presidential Election

getting bad healthcare This ended ObamaCare as we knew it Thank you TRANSPARENCY in medical pricing will be one of the biggest and most important things done for the American citizen It was just put

knows we have done a great job on Testing just like we have on Ventilators and everything else He lied gave NY SALT Run AOC It is about the Economy stupid except when it comes to Trump The fact is the Fake News Media hates talking about the Economy and how incredible it is As per recent Federal Court ruling the Federal Government will be withholding funds from Sanctuary Cities They should change their status and go nonSanctuary Do not protect criminals Big day for JUSTICE Congratulations John Caught in the act This is Fake News by the failing bad ratings Never suggested it although based on all of the many things accomplished during the first years perhaps more than any other Presidency sounds like a good idea to me The Do Nothing Democrats and their leader the Fake News Lamestream Media are doing everything possible to hurt and disparage our Country No matter what we do or say no matter how big a win they report that it was a loss or not good enough The Enemy of the People Watch Just arrived in Pennsylvania Enjoy DAYS TO SLOW THE SPREAD COVID You cannot make this up David Kris a highly controversial former DOJ official was just appointed by the FISA Court to oversee reforms to the

called me to stop it No wonder Cuomo most others cannot stand him AOC I NEVER said people that are feeling sick should go to work This is just more Fake News and disinformation put out by the Democrats in particular MSDNC Comcast covers the CoronaVirus situation horribly only looking to do harm to the incredible successful effort being made The Governor of Michigan should give a little and put out the fire These are very good people but they are angry They want their lives back again safely See them talk to them make a deal Schumer has brought great danger to the steps of the United States Supreme Court Wow Crazy Bernie Sanders is surging in the polls looking very good against his opponents in the Do Nothing Party So what does this all mean Stay tuned Congress must pass the old

Justices We are shattering every record Read all about this in The Long Game a great new book by Mitch McConnell Amazing story The ONLY reason we were able to get our great USMCA Trade Deal approved was because the Do Nothing Democrats wanted to show that they could approve something productive in light of the fact that all they even think about is impeachment She knows nothing about the USMCA Deal the American publics tone deafness amp it should be intolerable because the American people have had it with this The Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats have gone CRAZY They want to make it as hard as possible for me to properly run our Country The Trump Administration Trump policies have put our economy on a trajectory it has never been on before Griff Jenkins Stocks kick off Christmas week at AllTime Record Highs mount some kind of public pressure to demand witnesses but McConnell has the votes and he can run this trial anyway he wants to Everything we are seeing from Speaker Pelosi and Senator Schumer suggests that they are in real doubt about the evidence they have brought forth so far not being good enough and are very very urgently seeking a way to find some more evidence The only way to make this work is to The Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats said they wanted to RUSH everything through to the Senate because President Trump is a threat to National Security they are vicious will say anything but now they do not want to go fast anymore they want to go very slowly Liars Look the House is supposed to do all of this work on witnesses and documents BEFORE they send the articles over to the Senate not to call in new witnesses go through new documents that work is supposed to be done in the House We are getting MS gang members and many other people that

Graham for stating that his father the late great Billy Graham voted for me in the Election I know how pleased you are with the work we have all done together I guess the magazine Christianity Today

Dems on stage I will not be reading ET again A far left magazine or very progressive as some would call it which has been doing poorly and has not been involved with the Billy Graham family for many years Christianity Today knows nothing about reading a perfect transcript of a routine phone call and would rather The reason the Democrats do not want to submit the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is that they do not want corrupt politician Adam Shifty Schiff to testify under oath nor do they want the Whistleblower the missing second Whistleblower the informer the Bidens to testify The House Democrats were unable to get even a single vote from the Republicans on their Impeachment Hoax The Republicans have never been so united The Dems case is so bad that they do not even want to go to trial So after the Democrats gave me no Due Process in the House no lawyers no witnesses no nothing they now want to tell the Senate how to run their trial Actually they have zero proof of anything they will never even show up They want out I want an immediate trial The great USMCA Trade Deal Mexico amp Canada has been sitting on Nancy Pelosis desk for months she does not even know what it says amp today after passing by a wide margin in the House Pelosi tried to take credit for it Labor will vote for Trump Trade deal is great for USA Jesse Watters this is the best year any President has

costly and unpopular individual mandate for you Approval Rating in the Republican Party Thank you Also leading in most swing states THANK YOU NEW HAMPSHIRE Rasmussen was one of the most accurate polls in Actually I think based on Crowds and Enthusiasm of which Sleepy Joe has none that we are MUCH higher than The only thing Joe can count on is that a Federal Judge does not eviscerate the Fake Ballot Rigging Scam The Senate shall set the time and place of the trial If the Do Nothing Democrats decide in their great wisdom not to show up they would lose by Default Republican Vote That is what people

dangerous to simply let the American people pick the next president in Looking like a big win for Boris in the YOUK Thank you Charlie Nancy Pelosi just got duped in an interview to admitting that she has been working on impeaching me for two and a half years In other words she lied This was the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats plan all along long before the Ukraine phone call Impeachment Hoax What is gone on the last three years is not reasonable The majority has been so abusive by Congress by the Justice Department amp FBI friends of the Democrats who hated the president when he was nothing but a candidate At some point somebody should have said wait a minute this is out of control this train is off the tracks it is time to get reasonable This is so surreal For three years this President has been harassed He is been electronically surveilled spied upon allegations have never ceased they continue and their continuing today At some point you would think you would look at the abuse I think it is obvious to all the American public that this is a railroad job I also have constantly asked Why are not Germany France and other European countries helping Ukraine more They are

Republican National Convention in Charlotte at the end of August Unfortunately Democrat Governor is still in Shutdown mood unable to guarantee that by August we will be allowed full attendance in the Arena In other words we would be spending millions of dollars building the Arena to a very high standard without even knowing if the Democrat Governor would allow the Republican Party to fully occupy the space Plans are being Drug companies which are being forced by me to substantially reduce Drug Prices are taking millions in ads saying I want to increase Medicare Primiums Wrong just the opposite

that a good look Fortunately I rejected their advice on keeping our borders open to China early on Why did they give us such a faulty recommendation GREAT NEWS KAG Religious Liberty among many other things are OVER and GONE Landing in New Hampshire Sean Parnell is an American Hero Conor Lamb has proven to be an American fraud and a puppet for Crazy Nancy Pelosi He said he would NOT vote for her for Speaker and did Will kill A Voted to impeach on nothing A TOTAL COMPLETE Sean Parnell Endorsement Loser The DACA decision while a highly political one and seemingly not based on the law gives the President of the United States far more power than EVER anticipated Nevertheless I will only act in the best interests of the United States of America The AntiBenghazi Why did not the IG who spent years with the Obama Administration Did she Report on the failed HN Swine Flu debacle where people died want to talk to the Admirals Generals VP others in charge before doing her report Another Fake Dossier it is alienating independents This President is being persecuted over three years with one investigation after another and that really plays to his base Their partisan Witch Hunt is hurting our Country do badly amp only bringing more division than ever Now it looks like the fore person in the jury in the Roger Stone case had significant bias Add that to everything else and this is not looking good for the Justice Department Sohrab Ahmari New York Post The Trump Campaign raised million in the two days following the impeachment Scam vote It seems the Democrats have shot themselves in the foot in one more way They set up a process they know is not going to lead to the Presidents removal amp THANK YOU NEW HAMPSHIRE Remember when Pelosi was screaming that President Trump is a danger to our nation and we must move quickly They did not get one Republican House vote and lost Dems They produced no case so now she does not want to go to the Senate She is all lies Most overrated person I know Deven Nunes predicts that more examples of Mueller team misconduct will be revealed in coming weeks The recent Supreme Court decisions not only on DACA Sanctuary Cities Census and others tell

overcome setbacks to share your stories with AmericaWorksTogether Mini Mike Bloomberg is a LOSER who has money but cannot debate and has zero presence you will see He reminds me of a tiny version of Jeb Low Energy Bush but Jeb has more political skill and has treated the Black community much better than Mini about whether or not Joe could have done such a horrible thing Maybe or maybe not but I find Joe to be a total Nut Job and I knew him well far better than most So many unanswered obvious questions but I will not bring them up now Law enforcement eventually will The opening of a Cold Case against Psycho Joe Scarborough was not a Donald Trump original thought this has been going on for years long before I joined the chorus In when Joe his wacky future exwife Mika would endlessly interview me I would always be thinking As President of the United States I am asking for a legal solution on DACA not a political one consistent with the rule of law The Supreme Court is not willing to give us one so now we have to start this process all over again Great Job by Judicial Watch Potentially a treasure trove Too bad you are not given more help but it will all work out Stock Market up BIG DOW crosses SP over States should open up AS SOON AS POSSIBLE The Transition to Greatness has started ahead of schedule There will be ups and downs but next year will be one of the best ever Mini

you greatly When we are no longer here he will only speak well of you Wrong Biden was asked questions at his socalled Press Conference yesterday where he read the answers from a teleprompter That means he was given the questions just like Crooked Hillary Never have seen this before One person lost to this invisible virus is too much it should have been stopped at its source China but I acted very quickly and made the right decisions Many of the current political complainers thought at the time that I was moving far to fast like Crazy Nancy For all of the political hacks out there if I had not done my job well early we would have lost to Million People as opposed to the plus that looks like will be the number That is to times more than we will lose I shut down entry from China very early I am watching a great and beautiful service by Pastor Jentezen Franklin Thank you First thing the anarchists did upon taking over Seattle was BUILD A WALL See I was ahead of our times If the

matters the way they should have been taken care of days ago Moving up News Conference to Enjoy When I terminated John Kelly which I could not do fast enough he knew full well that he was way over his head Being Chief of Staff just was not for him He came in with a bang went out with a whimper but like so many Xs he misses the action just cannot keep his mouth shut horrible BLM chant Pigs In A

Spend this money fighting crime instead How brilliant are our FARMERS Thank you real talent MAGA We are doing very precise Medical Screenings at our airports Pardon the interruptions and delays we are moving as quickly as possible but it is very important that we be vigilant and careful We must get it right Safety first It was not Ambassador Lighthizers fault yesterday in Committee in that perhaps I did not make myself clear but the YOUS certainly does maintain a policy option under various conditions of a complete decoupling from China Thank you A total double standard The only thing the Dems have going for them is their very close relationship with the Fake News Lamestream Media Did not Obama whose Administration has now been caught cold illegally spying on the Trump campaign recently also get caught playing golf on a course in Virginia despite his wife Michelle urging people to stay home before and after his round in a major public service message I am seeing Governor Cuomo today at The White House He must understand that National Security far exceeds politics New York must stop all of its unnecessary lawsuits harrassment start cleaning itself up and lowering taxes Build

Biden betrayed Scranton and America to China and foreign countries I will always put America First will not convict and remove the President Then the House should not be Impeaching the President in the first place If this is the new standard every President from here on out is impeachable Andy McCarthy So well stated Thank you In the end here nothing happened We do not approach anything like the egregious conduct that should be necessary before a President should be removed from office I believe that a President cannot be removed from office if there is no reasonable possibility that the Senate The evidence has to be overwhelming and it is not It is not even close Ken Starr Former Independent Counsel Will go down in history as worst Speaker Already thrown out once Thank you Impeachment is a terrible idea for the Country The more people learn about impeachment the less people want impeachment This is all about convicting a President based on innuendo not on the facts Even the Ukrainian President said there was no pressure Thank you Thank you Sean P is a much stronger candidate Sean is a great patriot and will do a fantastic job Has my total and complete endorsement out and he is been amazing at it The Democrsts have no message they have no hope for Thank you Doug had while the Democrats are just looking out for elections This President should just continue to fight like he is always fought for himself amp for this Country Continue to put forth policies like prescription drugs amp trade policies That is what makes this President stand said I am going to clean up Washington I am going to help people He gave big tax cuts he is made our military strong They are mad at him because he actually did what he said he was going to do History will record we are experiencing some of the best times we have ever It is sad Here is a gentleman who came to the White House and all they had was never to let him have an easy breath All they wanted to do is impeach him They started the day after he was elected even the day after he was sworn in But this President came to Washington and They just wanted to get at the President They had no intention of having a proper investigation They could not find any crimes so they did a vague abuse of power and abuse of Congress which every administration from the beginning has done Can you believe that I will be impeached today by the Radical Left Do Nothing Democrats AND I DID NOTHING WRONG A terrible Thing Read the Transcripts This should never happen to another President again Say a PRAYER foxandfriends My hope is that impeachment will never become this trivial again Well said Brian marcthiessen Voters say the Democrats are trying to take away their votes Pelosi was right the first time Impeachment has backfired thoroughly on the Democrats How can you Impeach the President for going to the courts They want to Impeach me I am not worried and yet they were all breaking the law in so many ways How can they do that and yet impeach a very successful Economy Plus President of the United States who has done nothing wrong These people are Crazy So if Comey amp the top people in the FBI were dirty cops and cheated on the FISA Court would not all of these phony cases have to be overturned or dismissed They went after me with the Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary amp the DNC which they illegally presented to FISA Good marks and reviews on the letter I sent to Pelosi today She is the worst No wonder with people like her and Cryin Chuck Schumer DC has been such a mess for so long and that includes the previous administration who and now we know for sure SPIED on my campaign Democrat leadership despite their denials are putting tremendous pressure on their members to vote yes on this ridiculous Impeachment If they vote yes it will be much easier for Republicans to win in Wow In a stunning rebuke of the FBI the FISA court severly chastised the FBI for the FISA abuses brought to light in the recent Inspector Generals Report There were at least significant errors Statement by the Court was long and tough Means my case was a SCAM Senator Dan Sullivan is doing a great job for

who has not committed any impeachable offenses Senator Josh Hawley RMo They the Dems do not have anything This whole thing is a joke and it is time to get the President exonerated The House has no evidence of any impeachable offense There is nothing there and they did not even charge a crime They have had their good practice As you saw last night they were very cool very professional Never let it get out of hand Thank you On the bad side the DC Mayor who is always looking for money help would not let the DC Police get involved Not their job Nice have been greeted with the most vicious dogs and most ominous weapons I have ever seen That is when people would have been really badly hurt at least Many Secret Service agents just waiting for action We put the young ones on the front line sir they love it and Biden is a corrupt globalist sellout who never missed a chance to stab American workers in the back If Biden wins China wins it is just that simple Joe Biden delivered remarks to union members after spending years giving their jobs to China and foreign countries in exchange for campaign cash And if the Federal Government was not getting ready to go in and we were all set it would still be a squatters anarchists mess Great going Jim Proud of you The Lamestream Media is truly out of control Look how they work conspire together They are the Enemy of the People but do not

business in Puerto Rico We are bringing it back from China and other faraway lands Today I announced two of the LARGEST grants in history to Puerto Rico to rebuild its electrical grid system and education system My Administration will be awarding BILLION through FEMA the largest obligations of funding ever awarded Would be sooo great if the Fed would further lower interest rates and quantitative ease The Dollar is very strong against other currencies and there is almost no inflation This is the time to do it Exports would zoom The new USA Today Poll just out has me leading all of

will NOT be shut down Embers or flare ups will be put out as necessary Obama was always wrong Looking back into history the response by the ObamaBiden team to the HN Swine Flu was considered a weak and pathetic one Check out the polling it is really bad The big difference is that they got a free pass from the Corrupt Fake News Media Attention MICHIGAN Early voting has started AND absentee ballots are being mailed out Take advantage of the early voting and absentee calendar Vote in person today or request an absentee ballot here Having been involved in the negotiations to put it mildly the number that OPEC is looking to cut is Million Barrels a day not the Million that is generally being reported If anything near this happens and the World gets back to business from the Covid I do not see any indication that there were any white supremest groups mixing in This is an ANTIFA Organization It seems that the first time we saw it in a major way was Occupy Wall Street It is the same mindset TRUE He has no idea so the answer is yes They say Roger Stone lied to Congress OH I see but so did Comey and he also leaked classified information for which almost everyone other than Crooked Hillary Clinton goes to jail for a long time and so did Andy McCabe who also lied to the FBI FAIRNESS The ObamaBiden Administration was the most corrupt in history including the fact that they got

Administration and I are working closely with the Governors and this will continue A decision by me in conjunction with the Governors and input from others will be made shortly For the purpose of creating conflict and confusion some in the Fake News Media are saying that it is the Governors decision to open up the states not that of the President of the United States the Federal Government Let it be fully understood that this is incorrect John Kerry and Senator Chris Murphy grossly violated the Logan Act with respect to Iran If a Republican did what they did there would be very serious ramifications These were the people that trashed Seattle years ago Who is paying for these people I was appalled that of Joe Bidens staff were donating money to bail people out in Minneapolis They should have stayed in jail until this is over and beyond COVID China Virus Death Rate PLUNGES From Peak In YOUS A Tenfold Decrease In Mortality The Washington Times Valerie Richardson We have the lowest Mortality Rate in the World The Fake News should be reporting these most important of facts but they do not Many thousands of people work for our government With that said a former DISGRUNTLED

watching your debate performance last night of you winning the Democrat nominationBut I hope you do John Kasich did a bad job in Ohio ran for President and was easy to beat and now went to the other side desperate for relevance Good Job by Chris C in exposing yet another loser The decision not to prosecute Andy McCabe is utterly inexplicable First the Fake News Media said that it is not fair for the President of the United States to be giving news conferences but it is the only way I can reach the American People as seen in the below poll When the socalled rich guys speak negatively about the market you must always remember that some are betting big against it and make a lot of money if it goes down Then they go positive get big publicity and make it going up They get you both ways Barely legal A horrible Governor Crime is taking over NYC State everyone is leaving He is after the NRA They should move to Texas or elsewhere and must get tough Cuomo killed people in nursing homes alone

kind and a wonderful friend He will be truly missed As I have said for a long time dealing with China is a very expensive thing to do We just made a great Trade Deal the ink was barely dry and the World was hit by the Plague from China Trade Deals would not make up the difference and all those innocent lives lost Sleepy Joe Bidens people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail and probably more Joe does not know anything about it he is clueless but they will be the real power not Joe They will be calling the shots Big tax increases for all Plus People

WAY down and they will not be coming back I hope football and baseball are watching and learning because the same thing will be happening to them Stand tall for our Country and our Flag Corrupt Joe Biden said yesterday that we have over million people dead of Coronavirus On my way to PENNSYLVANIA The Art of an Oil Deal Rep Jim Jordan Delivers Knockout Blow to Schiffs Reputation Another misinformation campaign is being launched by Democrats in Congress saying that Russia prefers me to any of the Do Nothing Democrat candidates who still have been unable to after two weeks count their votes in Iowa Hoax number We know what took place We have already seen criminality What is happening Biggest political scandal of our time You are correct Maria it is a disgrace that nothing happens Obama and Biden spied on my campaign AND GOT CAUGHTBUT NOTHING Good luck to Sean Compton a winner at everything he does Paul Krugman is a lightweight thinker who does not have a clue Caused huge economic damage to his followers pocketbooks He and others should be fired by PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT Amazing analysis amp reporting If however the city or state in question is willing to acknowledge responsibility and politely asks for help from the Federal Government we will very seriously consider getting involved in order to make those poorly run Democrat Cities Great Again The homeless situation in Los Angeles San Francisco and many other Democrat Party run cities throughout the Nation is a state and local problem not a federal problem IRAN WILL NEVER HAVE A NUCLEAR WEAPON Congress amp the President should not be wasting their time and energy on a continuation of the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax when we have so many important matters pending to ZERO was the Republican House vote amp we got Dems This was not what the Founders had in mind The Impeachment Hoax just a continuation of the Witch Hunt which started even before I won the Election must end quickly Read the Transcripts see the Ukrainian Presidents strong statement NO PRESSURE get this done It is a con game by the Dems to help with the Election The reason they are not sending the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is that they are so weak and so pathetic The great Scam continues To be spending time on this political Hoax at this moment in our history when I am so busy is sad These Media Posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any YOUS person or target the United States will quickly amp fully strike back amp perhaps in a disproportionate manner Such legal notice is not required but is given nevertheless The United States just spent Two Trillion Dollars on Military Equipment We are the biggest and by far the BEST in the World If Iran attacks an American Base or any American we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their wayand without hesitation They attacked us amp we hit back If they attack again which I would strongly advise them not to do we will hit them harder than they have ever been hit before targeted Iranian sites representing the American hostages taken by Iran many years ago some at a very high level amp important to Iran amp the Iranian culture and those targets and Iran itself WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD The USA wants no more threats We catch them all hundreds of Iranian protesters He was already attacking our Embassy and preparing for additional hits in other locations Iran has been nothing but problems for many years Let this serve as a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans or American assets we have Christopher Bedford The Federalist Senior Editor There is NOTHING NEW in these Emails at all that is been discovered It is exactly what we knew before which is that the White House amp political figures wanted to cut off aid Trump wanted to question aid to a number of It was amazing to watch three days of arguments dismantled in two hours General Qassem Soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time and was plotting to kill many morebut got caught He was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people including the recent large number had happened to a Presidential candidate or President who was a Democrat everybody involved would long ago be in jail for treason and more and it would be considered the CRIME OF THE CENTURY far bigger and more sinister than Watergate A lot of very good people were taken down by a small group of Dirty Filthy Cops politicians government officials and an investigation that was illegally started amp that SPIED on my campaign The Witch Hunt is sputtering badly but still going on Ukraine Hoax If this They do not know how to do that The Supreme Court sends case back to Lower Court arguments to continue This is all a political prosecution I won the Mueller Witch Hunt and others and now I have to keep fighting in a politically corrupt New York Not fair to this Presidency or Administration On my way see you soon It never ends Now they are trying to say that your favorite President me went to Walter Reed Medical Center having suffered a series of ministrokes Never happened to THIS candidate FAKE NEWS Perhaps they are referring to another candidate from another Party This is what Democrats have done They want to create the idea that there is all this smoke so people think there is fire They did this with Russia Collusion there was no fire It makes zero sense what the Democrats are accusing him of Courts in the past have given broad

    "Some news medias have public Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). APIs are a way for computer(s) to communicate with each other through requests and responses. For instance, imagine trying to open ```https://www.youtube.com/```. Immediately, a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol, which manages the transfer of information (packets) between the computers) is established. Your computer sends a GET request to youtube's client. Essentially, your computer takes the HTTP, extracts it, checks the domain, the part after the http, and asks the Domain Name Server to return the respected IP address. After receiving the IP address, it will initiate the GET request, which the server will send a response.\n",
